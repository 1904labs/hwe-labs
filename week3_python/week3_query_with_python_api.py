#Question 1: Read the tab separated file named "resources/reviews.tsv.gz" into a dataframe.
#You will use the "reviews" dataframe defined here to answer all the questions below...

#Question 2: Display the schema of the dataframe.

#Question 3: How many records are in the dataframe? 
#Store this number in a variable named "reviews_count".

#Question 4: Print the first 5 rows of the dataframe. 
#Some of the columns are long - print the entire record, regardless of length.

#Question 5: Create a new dataframe based on "reviews" with exactly 1 column: the value of the product category field.
#Look at the first 50 rows of that dataframe. 
#Which value appears to be the most common?

#Question 6: Find the most helpful review in the dataframe - the one with the highest number of helpful votes.
#What is the product title for that review? How many helpful votes did it have?

#Question 7: How many reviews have a 5 star rating?

#Question 8: Currently every field in the data file is interpreted as a string, but there are 3 that should really be numbers.
#Create a new dataframe with just those 3 columns, except cast them as "int"s.
#Look at 10 rows from this dataframe.

#Question 8: Find the date with the most purchases.
#Print the date and total count of the date with the most purchases

#Question 9: Add a column to the dataframe named "review_timestamp", representing the current time on your computer. 
#Print the schema and inspect a few rows of data to make sure the data is correctly populated.

#Question 10: Write the dataframe with load timestamp to s3a://hwe-$CLASS/$HANDLE/bronze/reviews_static in Parquet format.
#Make sure to write it using overwrite mode: append will keep appending duplicates, which will cause problems in later labs...

#Question 11: Read the tab separated file named "resources/customers.tsv.gz" into a dataframe
#Write to S3 under s3a://hwe-$CLASS/$HANDLE/bronze/customers
#Make sure to write it using overwrite mode: append will keep appending duplicates, which will cause problems in later labs...
#There are no questions to answer about this data set right now, but you will use it in a later lab...

# Stop the SparkSession
