## Week 2 Stretch Challenge
In the week 2 stretch challenge you will implement a unit tested method body that requires Spark.
We complete this exercise as a gentle introduction to unit testing.  If you want to know why unit
testing is important, [please watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ezz5nAH1opA).
In later weeks we will do a deeper dive to disect the components of the unit test so by the end
of this course you know how to write your own unit tests from scratch.
