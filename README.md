# Repo Overview

- [Week 1 - Environment Setup](week1_welcome/README.md) - Configure your environment to begin the programming course work
- [Week 2 - Spark SQL](week2_sql/README.md) - write a Python Spark application to analyze local Amazon review data
- [Week 3 - Write to Amazon S3](week3_python/README.md) - the program will now connect to Amazon S3 and write data to the storage
- [Week 4 - Kafka + Bronze layer](week4_kafka_bronze/README.md) - read from Kafka instead of the local file, and use Spark structured streaming to be output to Amazon S3 creating the Bronze layer
- [Week 5 - Silver layer](week5_silver/README.md) - transform and enrich data from the Bronze layer, creating the Silver layer
